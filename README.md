1. Install ZIP archive with all necessary files.

2. In the folder where EsgrimaOnlineGamesflow.swf and ARFlashPlayer.exe are located, find the ARFlashPlayer file and double click on it to launch the Flash player;

3. Once ARFlashPlayer is running, all we have to do is drag and drop the EsgrimOnlineGamesflow.swf file into the running program.

4. Next, the game itself will load, where the registration and authorization dialogs will appear.

Accounts are registered and authorized, carefully watch what password and login you enter for registration, because in the future the account can not be restored. 

For those who already had an account. Registered accounts on other clients (Kongr–µgate, Miniclip, etc.) are also quietly authorized on this client, just enter the correct login and password and click the authorization button.

Good luck!
